# Classify cis/trans inheritance pattern using inbred/hybrid expression data

* These R packages need to be installed: `tidyverse`, `VGAM`, `gamlss` and `BiocParallel`
* Open [ase.R](ase.R) in R/Rstudio and run the script using demo datasets ([demo_parents.tsv](demo_parents.tsv) and [demo_hybrid.tsv](demo_hybrid.tsv)).
* If the script runs through you should be able to get the output file ([demo_out.tsv](demo_out.tsv)), with the last column being the cis/trans regulatory pattern.
* Prepare your own data in the same format and run the script.
